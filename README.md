# Deep Learning Study 📚

Welcome to my personal deep learning study repository! This space is dedicated to tracking my progress and sharing my learning journey in deep learning. The topics listed below are my end goals—areas I aim to explore and master over time. Not all topics are covered yet, but this repo will grow as I learn.

## Topics To Be Covered

- **Image Processing & Computer Vision**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  - Image classification, segmentation, and object detection
  - Data augmentation and preprocessing
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - Language modeling (n-grams, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers)
  - Text classification, sentiment analysis
  - Sequence-to-sequence models
- **Generative Models**
  - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Fundamentals**
  - Neural network basics
  - Activation functions, loss functions
  - Optimization techniques
- **Other Topics**
  - Transfer learning
  - Attention mechanisms
  - Reinforcement learning (basics)
